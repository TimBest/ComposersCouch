h2. Installation

<pre>pip install django-scheduler</pre>

h2. Configuration

edit your settings.py

add to *INSTALLED_APPS*:
    <pre>'schedule'</pre>

add to *TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS*:
    <pre>"django.core.context_processors.request"</pre>

h4. Optional Settings

*FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK*

This setting determines which day of the week your calendar begins on if your locale doesn't already set it. Default is 0, which is Sunday.

*OCCURRENCE_CANCEL_REDIRECT*

This setting controls the behavior of :func:`Views.get_next_url`. If set, all calendar modifications will redirect here (unless there is a `next` set in the request.)

*SHOW_CANCELLED_OCCURRENCES*

This setting controls the behavior of :func:`Period.classify_occurence`. If True, then occurences that have been cancelled will be displayed with a css class of canceled, otherwise they won't appear at all.

Defaults to False

*CHECK_PERMISSION_FUNC*

_deprecated_

Should be replaced with CHECK_EVENT_PERM_FUNC

*CHECK_EVENT_PERM_FUNC*

This setting controls the callable used to determine if a user has permission to edit an event or occurrence. The callable must take the object (event) and the user and return a boolean.

Default:
<pre>check_edit_permission(ob, user):
    return user.is_authenticated()
</pre>

If ob is None, then the function is checking for permission to add new events

*CHECK_CALENDAR_PERM_FUNC*

This setting controls the callable used to determine if a user has permission to add, update or delete an events in specific calendar. The callable must take the object (calendar) and the user and return a boolean.

Default:
<pre>check_edit_permission(ob, user):
    return user.is_authenticated()
</pre>

*GET_EVENTS_FUNC*

This setting controls the callable that gets all events for calendar display. The callable must take the request and the calendar and return a `QuerySet` of events. Modifying this setting allows you to pull events from multiple calendars or to filter events based on permissions

Default:
<pre>get_events(request, calendar):
    return calendar.event_set.all()
</pre>
